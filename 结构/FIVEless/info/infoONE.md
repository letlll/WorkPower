Abstract

Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower is a 125-story, 600+ meter mega-tower in China. The

tower structural system has been developed to harmonize with the architecture as an

integrated whole to maximize efficiency and enhance safety. The distinctive floor “slots”

help reduce the vortex shedding effect. Slot locations were coordinated to avoid causing

structural discontinuities. Above the roof, steel trussed tripod legs rise from tower plan wing

tips to seamlessly complete the building form with a dramatic crown. Design challenges

include evaluating building performance under seismic events through PBD and performing

Progressive Collapse Analyses to evaluate structural redundancy. Parametric modeling tools

were used to reduce cladding costs by maximizing the use of field-warped, flat-glazed panels

rather than costly curved glass panels.

Introduction

The wave of Mega-Tall building construction

in China started with cities along the east

coast and is now moving inland. Located in

Wuhan, an inland city adjacent to the Yangtze

River, the Wuhan Greenland Center Main

Tower is a 125-story, 600+ meter mega-tower

on track to be the 7th tallest building in the

world, a mixed-use skyscraper with offices

up through the 69th floor, apartments at

the 70th to 89th floors, a hotel from the 91st

floor to the top floor and a five (5)-story deep

basement housing the mechanical spaces

plus parking. Located at the tower top, a

unique 61m-tall tower crown and a 35m-tall

tower dome highlight the tower’s distinctive

personality. (see Figure 1).

The major structural system of Wuhan

Greenland Center Main Tower consisting of

robust composite walls, giant slightly sloping

composite SRC columns and curved belt

trusses, is adopted to resist the lateral loads

( wind or seismic ) effectively. The locations

and geometry of structural components have

been carefully optimized to not only provide

enough strengths and stiffness but integrate

with the architecture seamlessly.

Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower: Seamlessly Integrating

Structure and Architecture

武汉绿地中心主塔: 结构设计与建筑设计的完美结合 400

Tower Massing to Reduce the Wind Load

Like other super tall buildings, the lateral loads, wind and seismic, play

the most important role in the structural design of Wuhan Greenland

Center Main Tower. According to China “Code for Seismic Design

of Buildings “ (GB 50011-2010), Wuhan is located in the Seismic

Fortification Zone #6, with design ground acceleration specified as

0.05g under moderate earthquake, which is defined as a earthquake

with “10% Exceedance Probability in 50-year” or an earthquake

with 475-year return period. RWDI performed wind tunnel tests to

determine the structural wind loads for tower strength and stiffness

design. For the strength designs of the tower structure, the 100-year

wind load and seismic load under frequent earthquake, which is

defined as “63% Exceedance Probability in 50-year” or an earthquake

with 50-year return period, shall be combined with gravity load. Unlike

most building codes , in which the seismic load case never combines

with the wind load case, the frequent earthquake load for this tower

needs to be combined with 100-year wind load as per “Technical

Specification for Concrete Structures of Tall Building “(JGJ 3-2010).

The Table 1 lists the 100-year wind load and code-base frequent

earthquake load. From Table 1, the base shear and overturning

moment under a 100-year wind load is much larger than the values

under the frequent earthquake load.

Architectural massing of the Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower

was developed to optimize both the structural and programmatic

performance of the building. Four primary design solutions were

implemented to deal with both of these issues: a tapered profile, a

dome top, triangular floor plans with rounded soft corners and the

vent slots (see Figure 2). Since all of these elements help to minimize

the negative effects of wind acting on Supertall buildings, they allowed

the quantity of structural materials to be reduced and significantly

decreased the construction cost.

From a structural perspective, every Supertall building is a cantilever

beam in vertical direction, with lateral loads (wind or seismic) and

construction costs increasing dramatically as the building height

increases. A tapered profile has been proved effective in reducing

overall tower lateral loads and has been adopted for many Supertall

buildings around the world. Architecturally, the tapering shape also

helps to resolve different floor plate size requirements for varied

program elements without using a traditional step profile for the

building massing.

Programmatically, Supertall buildings are usually developed as mixed

use projects. Multiple entrances at Ground Level distinguish each type

of user and control access. Floor plates typically reduce in size and

lease span as the building rises into the sky. The Wuhan Greenland

Center Main Tower provides spaces for three distinctive functions:

office, apartment and hotel. While some mixed-use towers separate

users by levels, the triangular floor plan of this building allows for the

tenants or visitors to have separate entrances all at Ground Level. Soft

corners and a round tower top not only help create unique public

加速度值为0.05g, 其中设计基本地震定义为50年超越概率为10%

的地震或回归期为475年的地震。RWDI进行风洞试验以确定用于

塔楼结构强度设计和刚度设计的风荷载。对于塔楼结构构件的强

度设计，100年风荷载和常遇地震荷载需要与重力荷载组合，其

中常遇地震被定义为50年超越概率为63%的地震或回归期为50年

的地震。在海外的设计规范中，地震荷载不要求与风荷载进行组

合。与其它海外的设计规范不同，《高层建筑混凝土结构技术规

程》(JGJ 3-2010)要求地震荷载与100年风荷载进行组合。表1列

出了100年风荷载和根据规范计算的常遇地震荷载数值并进行了

比较。根据表1，100年风荷载下的基底剪力和倾覆力矩均远大于

常遇地震下的数值。

为了获得最佳的建筑功能和结构性能，武汉中心主楼的建筑体量

在设计过程中进行了不断地优化，主要采取了以下四项措施：（

沿竖向）逐渐缩进的体型、穹拱式的塔冠、带圆角的三角形楼层

平面和散落在不同高度的风槽（参见图2）。由于这些措施能够

有效减小作用于超高层建筑的不利风荷载效应，所以结构材料的

用量可以得到节省，建造成本也会大幅降低。

从结构的角度上看，每一幢超高层建筑均可视为沿竖向的悬臂

梁。侧向荷载（风或地震）以及建造成本均会随建筑高度的增加

而急剧增加。逐渐缩进的建筑体型已经被证明可以有效地减小作

用于塔楼的整体侧向荷载，故被世界上许多超高层建筑所采用。

从建筑的角度上看，逐渐缩进的建筑体型有利于解决不同建筑

体量对楼层面积的不同需求，避免传统的呈阶梯状的楼层平面突

变。

超高层建筑项目通常具备多种建筑功能。在首层要对各类用户及

其通行加以区分。通常情况下，沿建筑高度方向楼层面积和出租

spaces that attract visitors to the building, but help reduce the tower

wind load. To further reduce the wind loads on the tower, openings

have been provided though the building in locations optimized

through wind tunnel testing. Three massing options, as shown in

Figure 3, were tested in a wind tunnel by RWDI. All three options had

tapered profiles. Option 1 featured a solid surface and served as the

baseline option. Option 2 featured an opening between the crown

and dome plus slotted floors at multiple elevations. Option 3 featured

wing walls and vertical slots. The overall tower wind loads for three

options from the wind tunnel test are listed in Table 2.

From Table 2, Option 2 reduced the overall wind load by 15% and 6.6%

along “X” and “Y” respectively, while Option 3 did not show a significant

wind load reduction. The wind tunnel consultant considered that,

the opening at the tower top made a great contribution to wind load

reduction. Architecturally, an opening at the tower top would separate

the whole tower top into an upper crown and a lower dome. So, in

addition to reducing the wind load at tower top, the opening at tower

top would give the tower a unique architectural feature. Therefore,

it was incorporated in the final design. In addition, a building

maintenance unit or window cleaning machine is concealed in the

crown to clean the dome surface.

Tower Lateral System

The structural system of Greenland Center Main Tower has been

carefully developed to harmonize with the architecture as an

integrated whole, to maximize efficiency and to enhance safety. The

central “Y” plan concrete core extends 31.3m in plan from the tower

center to its far ends at lower zones, and sets back twice at Levels 70

and 91. The core was organized to provide multiple benefits across

楼面的跨度大小均逐渐减小。武汉绿地中心塔楼拥有三个功能分

区：办公、公寓和酒店。虽然一些超高层建筑通过楼层位置来区

分租户和访客，本项目独特的三角形平面允许租户和访客在首层

拥有其独立的入口。采用圆弧曲线加以修饰的（三角形平面的）

角部以及位于塔顶的圆形拱顶创造出独特的功用空间，它不仅吸

引更多的游客，更有助于减小风荷载。为了进一步减小塔楼风荷

载，以风洞试验结果为指导，在塔楼某些部分开洞。（风洞试

验顾问）RWDI在风洞中测试了三个建筑体量布置方案（参见图3

）。三个方案均拥有逐渐收缩的体型。方案1在建筑立面没有开

洞。以方案1作为方案比较的基础，方案2的特点是塔冠和穹拱之

间存在空隙，并在建筑立面上存在局部开洞。方案3的特点是建

筑立面上存在翼墙和竖向开槽。 表2列出了由风洞试验获得的（

三种方案下的）塔楼整体风荷载。

由表2可以看出，（与方案1相比）方案2中“X”向和“Y”向的

风荷载分别减小15%和6.6%，而方案3中的风荷载没有明显的减

小。从建筑上看，（方案2中）塔楼顶部处的开口把塔顶分成上

部塔冠和下部穹拱两个部分，此举不仅减小了风荷载，而且赋予

塔楼一个独特的建筑特征。另外，用于清洗穹拱的塔冠围护设备

或擦窗机也可以隐藏于塔冠之中。最终方案2被采用。

different disciplines: separating office, hotel and apartment operational

functions, providing significant structural stiffness and strength for

the tower to resist lateral and gravity loads, and accommodating the

mechanical system floor and riser space requirements.

To maximize the structural stiffness given by a “Y” shape plan, a pair of

massive super columns (SC1) is located at the tip of each tower wing.

Two additional super columns (SC2) are spaced at approximately

one-third points along each face and serve to reduce the spans of

perimeter structural members. The super columns are Steel Reinforced

Concrete (SRC) columns, with welded built-up steel column shapes

embedded within large concrete columns up to 3.3m X 4.6m in plan

dimension. Steel outrigger trusses two and three stories tall connect

the super columns to the core walls at Levels 36 to 39, 67 to 70 and

101 to 103, in addition to cap trusses at Levels 121 to 123. Ten sets

of steel belt trusses following the building perimeter are distributed

along the tower height. Distributed almost uniformly along the tower

to maximize structural efficiency, all outrigger trusses and belt trusses

are located either at mechanical floors or refuge floors to avoid impact

on the leasable floors. Segmented belt trusses curved in plan tend to

twist under vertical loads. To restrain the twist of the segmented belt

trusses a horizontal floor bracing system, consisting of double angles

and steel floor beams, is provided at the top and bottom chord levels

of each belt truss. The tower structural system is shown in Figure 4.

Optimization of Slotted Floor Location

Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower’s unique architectural shape

evolved from a classic tapered tower with “Y” plan shape into an

elegant curvilinear figure. By locally omitting portions of floors and

perimeter framing at different elevations, “slots” are created in the

building envelope to provide a distinctive architectural personality

while reducing wind loads on the structure from vortex shedding. (see

Figure 5).

Slot locations were carefully coordinated to avoid causing structural

discontinuities. Originally, the slots are located at mechanical levels. A

Vierendeel truss system would seem to be a natural structural solution

at slotted floors, since the lack of diagonals would allow the most air

flow. However, Vierendeel truss systems have two major drawbacks.

First, structural efficiency is much less than for traditional truss systems

塔楼抗侧力体系

经过（设计者）精心地优化，绿地中心主楼的结构体系与建筑融

为一体，以便最大限度地提高结构效率和增强安全性。平面上

呈“Y”型的混凝土核心筒（从其底区）从塔楼中心点到其最外

边的距离达31.3米。（这种对）核心筒的布置不仅有利于区分办

公、旅馆和公寓的功能，也为塔楼结构提供巨大的结构刚度和承

载力以承担侧向力和重力荷载，同时增大了容纳机电设备的空间

和管井空间。

为了最大限度地发挥“Y”形平面的结构刚度，在（Y形平面的）

各肢最外端位置分别布置一对巨柱（SC1）。为了减小外周结构

构件的跨度，在塔楼周围每边约在每个Y形平面的三分之一的

位置 各布置2根巨柱（SC2）。巨柱的最大截面尺寸达3.3 m×

4.6m左右并加入由钢板焊接而成的组合钢柱。两至三层高的钢外

伸臂桁架把巨柱与核心筒相连。外伸臂桁架布置在第36层至39

层、第67层至70层以及第101层至103层之间，另外在第121层至

123层之间布置帽桁架。在塔楼高度方向沿建筑周边布置十道钢

环带桁架。外伸臂桁架和环带桁架沿建筑高度方向接近均匀分布

以最大限度地发挥结构效率，同时所有桁架均布置于机电层或避

难层以避免对出租面积的影响。平面上呈折线形的（环带）桁架

在重力荷载作用下有扭转的倾向，故在（环带）桁架上下弦杆平

面布置水平支撑体系以约束桁架的受扭。楼面水平支撑体系由楼

面钢梁和双角钢斜撑组成。塔楼的结构体系如图4所示。

风槽楼层位置的优化

武汉绿地中心主楼的建筑外形在经典的“Y”形平面基础上逐步

演化，最终成为具有优雅曲线的独特外形。在不同的建筑标高位

置，通过去掉局部楼面及位于建筑外周的部分结构构件形成建筑

立面上的(开口)“风槽”。这些“风槽”既赋予建筑物与众不同

的个性，又减小了由风旋涡脱落引起的结构风荷载（参见图5）

。

“风槽”的位置经过了精心地选择以避免结构的不连续性。在设

计初期，这些风槽布置于机电层。由于空腹桁架没有斜腹杆，便

于更多气流通过，所以位于风槽层（即机电层）的环带桁架采用

空腹桁架的形式似乎是合理的选择。然而空腹桁架有两个主要

缺点。首先，空腹桁架的结构效率远不如带斜腹杆的传统桁架体

系。其次，环带桁架作为转换桁架支承位于相邻两个环带桁架层

with diagonal members. Second, as they serve as transfer trusses

supporting perimeter columns in one zone bounded by adjacent belt

truss levels, the trusses are critical to prevent progressive collapse by

carrying additional load from columns acting as hangers in the event

of failure of a perimeter column below (see Figure 6). After discussions

between the architect and structural engineer, the slotted floors were

located below the belt truss floors; and the continuous perimeter

belt trusses are of conventional design, reducing construction costs

compared to Vierendeels. Secondary steel columns are also interrupted

by the wind slots. In the progressive collapse analysis, floor beams can

span loads normally carried by those columns if the discontinuous

perimeter steel column below the floor slots fails. Those loads would

then be redirected to adjacent columns.

Vortex shedding is defined as an unsteady flow that occurs at building

corners due to the formation and detachment of alternating low

–pressure vortices or wind whirlpools on the leeward side of the

edge of an object. Cyclic formation and shedding of vortices applies

cyclic wind loads to a building that can generate large crosswind

movements if not suppressed. Floor slots let some wind pass through

building corners to the leeward side, inhibiting the formation of

vortices and reducing the effects of vortex shedding. Although the

total downwind load (drag) on the tower will not be reduced much by

the relatively small slots at limited locations, the slots do help reduce

vortex shedding locally.

While the slots were welcomed by the structural engineer as a way to

achieve an efficient structure through optimized floor slot locations,

the Architect took advantage of the slot voids and created fantastic

view opportunities at the unique spaces.

Performance of Core Wall Under Severe Earthquake

For a building taller than 600 meters, a nonlinear structural analysis

to check building performance under a severe earthquake, defined

as “2% Exceedance Probability in 50 years” or a 2475-year earthquake,

is mandatory in China per the Technical Specification for Concrete

Structures of Tall Building (JGJ 3-2010). Following the principles

of Performance-Based Design and using the material constitutive

relationship curves specified in China codes to define material

nonlinearity, the structural engineer created a mathematical model

using analysis software ABACUS and performed nonlinear time

history analyses under seven sets of acceleration time-histories

records. In initial analyses, the core walls at top levels were found to

experience excessive nonlinear demand and failed to achieve targeted

performance levels. The extent of upper level wall damage resulted

in an extremely long analysis time to reach the converge point, nearly

one week for each time-history record. The damage was apparently

related to core property changes from a major core wall setback at

Level 91 (see Figure 7). As a way to alleviate predicted wall damage, the

Architect and structural engineer jointly decided to reduce the change

in core properties by having smaller wall setbacks, simply extending

some core wall portions to Level 123 that were originally stopping

at Level 91 (see Figure 8). Extending those wall segments increased

tower core strength and stiffness, reduced predicted wall damage

under the severe earthquake case and helped the core structure

achieve performance level goals. Reduced wall nonlinear behavior was

also reflected in analysis run times as each analysis converged much

faster, and the run time to finish one time-history record reduced to

just two days. The Architect adjusted the stair layout to accommodate

the added walls and reduced the number of guest room types, which

was welcomed by the hotel operator.

之间的外周重力柱，当环带桁架下方某一楼层的外周重力柱失

效时，（失效楼层以上的）重力柱作为吊杆把楼层荷载传至（上

方）环带桁架，因此环带桁架在抗连续倒塌体系中有至关重要的

作用（参见图6）。经过建筑师和结构工程的协调配合，风槽层

被布置于环带桁架层之下，这样环带桁架层可采用传统的（带斜

腹杆的）桁架形式；与空腹桁架相比可节省建造成本。风槽层也

造成了某些次要周边柱（在竖向）的不连续。在抗连续倒塌分析

中，当位于风槽层下方楼层的非连续重力柱失效时，这些楼层的

楼面梁（被设计为）可以承担原先由失效重力柱承担的楼面荷载

并把这些楼面荷载传至相邻柱子。

风旋涡脱落被定义为发生在建筑物角部的紊流。它发生于物体的

下风向边缘处，由低压涡流（或风旋涡）的交替产生和脱离造

成。如果不加以控制，周期性的旋涡生成和脱离造成施加于建筑

物上的周期性风荷载，即横向风荷载。风槽层能让风直接穿过建

筑物角部到达下风向一侧，故可以抑制旋涡脱落的形成，从而

减小旋涡脱落的影响。虽然作用在塔楼上的总体顺风向荷载（拖

力）不会因为局部存在的小风槽的影响而减小太多，但是这些风

槽肯定对减小局部的风旋涡脱落有帮助。

由于可以利用风槽位置的优化达到提高结构效率的目的，风槽得

到了结构工程师的欢迎，而建筑师则利用风槽创造出独特的空间

和奇妙的景观。

核心筒在罕遇地震下的性能

依据《高层建筑混凝土结构技术规程》（JGJ3-2010），对于600

米以上的超高层建筑需要进行罕遇地震下的弹塑性结构分析以评

估建筑物在地震中的性能。罕遇地震定义为50年内超越概率为2%

或2475年一遇的强震。遵循性能化设计原则和使用中国规范定义

的材料非线性本构关系曲线，结构工程师利用分析软件ABACUS创

建数学模型，并输入7套地震波进行非线性时程分析。初步计算

表明塔楼顶部楼层核心筒墙体单元进入塑性的程度比较高，未能

达到预期的性能水准。对上部墙体损坏程度的运算需要很长的时

间才能达到收敛，每条地震波下的结构分析需要运算长达近一个

星期。计算结果表明该部分墙体性能的减弱明显与91层的主核心

筒的缩进有关。这一缩进显著改变了核心筒的力学性能（参见图

7）。为了减小这一影响，建筑师和结构师相互协作，将原方案

到91层就停止的部分核心筒墙体延伸到123 层，从而以最简洁的

方式保持了核心筒的力学性能（参见图8）。延伸的墙体增加了

塔楼核心筒的强度和刚度，降低了上部墙体在罕遇地震下的破

Tower Crown Structure

The top of the Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower is an expression

of the project design philosophy. As the tower reaches into the sky,

the cladding splits at the line between two architectural components

known as the body and the shield. This separation was created to help

alleviate tower top wind forces and thus significantly improve building

behavior. This simple but powerful statement about the effectiveness

of coordinating architecture and structure in Supertall building design

has become the building’s most iconic feature and is certain to create a

landmark on the city skyline.

Rising from gently tapering tower wing tips, the taper steadily and

continuously increases to the point that the tips converge on the

tower centerline to form a unique 61m tall crown (see Figure 9).

Tapering of other building surfaces defines a 35m tall dome. Cleaning

of the dome glass will be performed by equipment suspended from

the crown above. Cladding of the outer crown is supported by a

special tripod structural system. Because crown tripod leg framing

is concealed within opaque cladding, support structural design was

based on material efficiency and constructability. Each crown tripod

leg, a half-arch in profile, is trapezoidal in cross-section or plan. The

four faces of each leg are trusses following simple surfaces, with the

upper/outer and side trusses triangulated for shear stiffness and the

lower/inner truss a Vierendeel without diagonals. Pipes up to 500 mm

diameter are used for truss chords and smaller diameter pipes are used

for web members and braces. The inner truss Vierendeel configuration

and the hollow tripod leg design without internal diaphragms were

both selected to work with the window washing machine within. The

side trusses taper nearly to a point at the crown base, landing on the

super columns at wing tips and connecting directly to the embedded

steel columns in the super column for secure load transfer.

The tower dome structure posed different design challenges. Dome

cladding is transparent but substantial cladding support framing is

required at long spans and high wind pressures. Viewing up through

the peak of the dome is desired. Dome structural framing will be visible

to visitors so a dramatic sculptural appearance is desired.

Multiple structural schemes were proposed by the structural engineer

for consideration by the architect. Systems included support framing

distributed along all faces, framing concentrated at discrete locations,

horizontal spanning schemes and vertically spanning schemes. For

each scheme the relative hierarchy of framing sizes and functions

塔楼冠层结构

武汉绿地中心主塔楼顶部集中表现了整座建筑的设计理念。随着

塔楼向上延伸，建筑表面逐渐分化为两个建筑部分：主体和外

壳。这种分离设计有利于减轻塔顶的风荷载，从而显著提高了建

筑的性能。这一简洁有力的设计证明了建筑和结构在超高层设计

互相协调的有效性，（该塔冠）为塔楼增添了最具标志性的特

征，无疑将使之成为武汉市天际线上的地标。

随着塔楼高度增加，塔楼翼缘逐渐锥化收缩，直到与塔楼中轴线

在顶部汇聚为一点，形成一个61米高的塔冠（参见图9）。而建

筑表面另一角度的锥化收缩形成了35米高的穹顶。穹顶玻璃幕墙

的清洗将由悬挂在塔冠上的擦窗机完成。塔冠建筑外幕墙采用一

个独特的三脚架结构体系支承。由于塔冠三脚架的桁架隐藏在不

透明的幕墙内，因此支承结构的设计要尽量考虑节省材料并有利

于施工。塔冠三脚架的每一个脚在竖向剖面上都呈半个拱形，横

截面为梯形。（三脚架的）每条支腿形成4个侧面，每一侧依建

筑的表面形状布置桁架。上/内侧和两边的三角形桁架提供了结

构的抗剪刚度，底/外侧则布置无斜杆的空腹式桁架。桁架支承

弦杆采用最大直径500mm的钢管，而桁架腹杆和斜杆选用小尺寸

的钢管。内侧桁架斜杆的形式和三脚架支架中空的布置保证了内

部擦窗机的正常工作。两侧边桁架逐渐收缩，在塔冠底部交汇为

一点，支承在翼缘端部的巨柱上，并直接与巨柱内的型钢相连

接，以保证荷载完全的传递到巨柱。

塔顶穹拱结构是设计上的另外一个挑战。穹拱幕墙是透明的，而

且支承构件有较大的跨度，承受较高的风荷载。此外，建筑上还

要求透过拱顶能够仰视景观。由于穹拱结构在观光层是可见的，

因此穹拱的结构设计需具有很强的空间雕塑美感。

结构工程师提出多个结构方案供建筑师选择。方案包含全穹拱均

匀分布式结构体系、局部集中布置式结构体系、水平支承式结构

体系和竖向支承式结构体系。无论每一种结构方案都综合考虑到

了构件尺度对层次感与建筑美学的影响，结构效率和施工可行

性。为减小水平环梁的直径，采用钢吊杆悬挂的方式来降低重力

方向上的跨度。由三弦杆桁架构成的外露的三脚架支承来自环梁

was considered for aesthetic intent, structural efficiency and

constructability. The selected system has horizontal curved pipe girts

to support the tower skin. To minimize girt pipe diameter, gravity load

spans are reduced by suspending the girts from steel hangar rods.

Exposed tripod legs framed as tri-chord trusses resist wind load from

the girts and gravity loads from the hangers. The inner chord of each

truss vanishes at the lowest truss panel so the tripod structure lands on

the tower wing tip columns and visually merges with the crown tripod

above and outside, while being separate for fabrication and erection

(see Figure 10). While one might expect the tripod legs to merge at

a peak through a solid compression hub, a different approach was

required to maintain views up through the dome. The legs stop before

the peak, and plane trusses are added at leg truss top panels to tie the

three Tripod legs together. The result is a space frame structure with

enhanced lateral stiffness of the dome.

The tower crown and dome structures were integrated with the

architectural design to provide a seamless envelope transition from

walls to crown and dome cladding while providing a column free

space for visitors. The clad crown trusses are visually solid objects

for reading clearly on the skyline. The exposed dome trusses read as

sculpture to visitors within the transparent dome, with minimal visual

obstruction by girts. All loads from the tower crown and dome flow

directly onto the super columns, providing short load paths and secure

connections.

Parametric Modeling Study to Simplify the Curtainwall

Modern graphical design tools offer architects great flexibility in shape

creation. Reaching a visually and functionally satisfactory shape

should not be the end of the design process. Often seemingly minor,

aesthetically and functionally acceptable adjustments to building

shapes can provide major benefits for building constructability. This

was the case for the Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower project.

The initial architectural design resulted in a unique exterior surface

geometry. The overall surface was very organic, based on numerous

curved splines determined and evaluated by visual observation.

However, it was clear to the architectural team that the form

required further evaluation and adjustments to permit developing

appropriate technical details, improve cladding economy and ensure

constructability.

Thornton Tomasetti’s Building Skin practice was engaged by AS+GG

to assist with this process. First the architect’s exterior surface model

was evaluated at non-planar surfaces for ‘warpage’ using Rhinoceros

software together with Grasshopper. In this case the focus was the

amount of surface warpage which might occur, relative to a series of

optional glazing patterns. This study allowed the team to identify and

quantify those portions of the facade which were warped beyond

the constructability limits associated with cold-bending of insulated

glass units (IGU’s) by applying force to a panel corner (see Figure 11).

The team quickly determined that cold-bending of the glass was not

an adequate solution for most of the tower using the initial geometry,

considering the significant areas of acute warpage that would be

required. To enclose the building with reasonable economy, while

retaining the original organic tower shape, would likely require that

the facade be re-modeled as shingled elements or that other three

dimensionally stepped forms be used.

A small group of detailing strategies were quickly developed and

presented to the architect for stepped forms suitable to meet the

缩进，在穹拱底部与塔冠三脚架交汇于翼端的巨柱，与上部塔冠

浑然一体，而施工时，穹拱与塔冠是分别进行吊装并连接在一起

的（参见图10）。若穹拱三脚架向上延伸并通过受压节点在顶点

交汇，则无法实现透过穹顶仰视景观，需另想办法。因此结构工

程师在接近穹顶的位置采用一个平面桁架将三脚架三条腿固定在

一起，因而留出顶端的空间。这样便形成了一个具有相当抗侧刚

度的空间结构体系。

塔冠和穹拱的结构设计与建筑设计完美结合，实现了流畅的建筑

外立面效果，巧妙解决了核心筒墙体、塔冠和穹拱之间的过渡关

系，同时实现了顶层的无柱大空间，利于游客观光。从整体上

看，塔冠实化，清晰可见，重点突出，而穹拱虚化，与塔冠相呼

应。穹拱内部三脚架具有较好的尺度空间感，加上小尺寸的环梁

支承玻璃幕墙，最大限度的实现了穹拱的通透效果。塔冠和穹拱

上的全部荷载都传递到了巨柱上，传力路径简洁明确，连接可靠

性高。

（运用）参数化建模简化幕墙设计

现代图形设计工具为建筑师在外形设计上提供了极大的便利。达

到视觉和功能都满意的外形不应是设计过程的结束。从美学和功

能角度对建筑外形作微小的调整，通常可以提高建筑施工的可行

性。武汉绿地中心主塔楼项目就是这样一个实例。

在最初的建筑中（塔楼）拥有一个独特的几何外形。（塔楼的）

整个外表面注重视觉效果，由大量的样条曲线组成，所以整体视

觉效果非常自然流畅。然而建筑设计团队知道: 为了改善幕墙建

造的经济性和施工的可行性，在技术细节方面需要作进一步的调

整。

Thornton Tomasetti (宋腾添玛沙帝) 的幕墙设计团队辅助

AS+GG来完成对建筑外表的调整。首先，通过Grasshopper 和

Rhinoceros设计软件对建筑师的几何模型进行翘曲参数分析。这

一过程的主要目的是分析在几种备选幕墙方案下的曲面翘曲程

度。这个分析能让设计团队找出并量化那些翘曲程度超过施工允

许范围的幕墙部分。幕墙板块翘曲的允许范围与中空玻璃板块的

冷弯能力有关。中空玻璃板块的冷弯是通过在板块的角部施加外

力而实现的（参见图11）。设计团队很快发现：塔楼幕墙存在大

量剧烈翘曲的部位，所以冷弯玻璃方案在许多区域无法达到原方

案的几何形状。为了达到保持原设计中自然的塔楼外表几何形

状，且兼顾建造的经济性，幕墙需要采用片状单元形式或其他在

三维空间内逐渐缩进的形式。

constructability demands of this massive high-rise tower. Two of the

strategies were collaboratively selected, and a revised hybrid approach

was established. This approach combined sloped trapezoidal panels --

flat and relatively ‘regular’ panel shapes capable of creating undulating

curved surfaces -- together with panels which would ‘step’ inward or

outward at each floor level.

Based on this approach, the designers returned to the original

architectural form, and began to re-generate the overall architectural

surface by replacing each of the non-uniform splines with compound

curves, a carefully developed series of arcs which were arranged

tangentially to mimic the original form of the tower. This was done for

the building sections as well as for each plan level. (see Figure 12).

Finally, using Grasshopper, a routine was developed to re-build nearly

the entire tower surface by using stepped and sloped trapezoidal

panels. At some portions of the tower other geometric strategies

for resolving the panelization were adopted that did not rely on

stepped forms. The geometric rebuilding process required numerous

iterations to determine the optimal panel sizes and alignments, based

on practical fabrication and erection limits, as well as the rigorous

aesthetic requirements.

Conclusions

The Wuhan Greenland Center Main Tower illustrates ways that

collaboration between architect, structural engineer and skin

consultant achieves a final design that addresses aesthetics,

functionality, load resistance and constructability in a seamless way at

all scales, from a 600+m cantilever to panels several meters wide.

幕墙设计师很快地找出了一些以细部设计为原则的应对策略并向

建筑师提交了一个采用逐步缩进的方案。这个方案可以满足该项

目对施工可行性的要求。（设计者）最后选出了两种设计策略并

混合使用，以形成一个修正的混合式方案。这一方案综合考虑了

倾斜式梯形板块——平的且相对“规则”并能够形成曲面效果的

板块以及楼层处内凹或凸出的板块。

按照这种方案，幕墙设计师对原建筑模型进行了重新生成。用复

合函数曲线替换了原来不均匀的样条曲线并用弧线相切的办法拟

合了原有的形状。对于剖面和平面都是采用这一方案（参见图12

）。

最后，该项目利用Grasshopper的参数化建模方法将塔楼表面划

分为若干倾斜且逐渐缩进的梯形板块，以此对大部分塔楼表面形

状进行拟合，并发展出一套逻辑原则。。此外，其它一些措施也

同时采用，以解决局部特别不规则的问题。几何模型的重建需要

进行大量的迭代运算，综合考虑建造工艺、安装和建筑美学，确

定最优的幕墙板块尺寸和布置方式。

结语

武汉绿地中心主塔楼是建筑师、结构工程师和幕墙设计师通过高

效协作共同完成的建筑杰作。它的每一部分，从几米尺度的板到

600米尺度超高层，都是建筑美学、建筑功能、荷载抵抗和施工

可行性的智慧结晶。
